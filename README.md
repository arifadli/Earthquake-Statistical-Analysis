<p align="justify">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of summarizing data using statistical and graphical approaches in order to highlight relevant features of that data for further examination. This entails analyzing the dataset from several perspectives and characterizing and summarizing it without making any assumptions about its contents.
Before entering into statistical modeling or machine learning, exploratory data analysis is a critical step to check the data is what it claims to be and that there are no evident flaws. Every organization's data science efforts should include it.</p>

<p align="justify">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important phase in the data analysis process that entails studying and summarizing a dataset in order to comprehend its properties, detect trends, and gain insights into it. EDA is often undertaken prior to the use of more complex statistical and machine learning techniques, and it aids in the formulation of hypotheses, the selection of relevant modeling methodologies, and the assurance of data quality. Here are some important components and techniques utilized in EDA: </p>
