# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

<p align="justify"><b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) </b>is the process of summarizing data using statistical and graphical approaches in order to highlight relevant features of that data for further examination. This entails analyzing the dataset from several perspectives and characterizing and summarizing it without making any assumptions about its contents.
Before entering into statistical modeling or machine learning, exploratory data analysis is a critical step to check the data is what it claims to be and that there are no evident flaws. Every organization's data science efforts should include it.</p>

<p align="justify">Using EDA, we can readily interpret the dataset, uncover patterns, identify outliers, and investigate the relationship between variables using non-graphical and graphical methodologies. EDA also aids us in determining which features to evaluate for our machine-learning model. (AKA feature selectio We now recognize that exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a critical component of a data science project for understanding data and gaining insight into each variable.</p>
