# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

An earthquake analysis that is exploratory in nature. In addition, machine learning techniques are being used to forecast future earthquakes. 

using Python
Scikit, matplotlib, anytree, basemap, numpy, mycolorpy and pandas were utilized as libraries.

Concerning Data
I relied on USGS Earthquake Data.
The data above is available in.csv file here.

Questions and Answers
Where do earthquakes occur most often?

Experiment
I calculated the frequency of earthquakes
I drew a graph to show the incidence of earthquakes per year.
I made a histogram between the frequency of earthquake events and several earthquake variables such as location (Longitude, Latitude) and Magnitude and depth
I made a scatter plot between earthquake variables such as location (Longitude, Latitude) and Magnitude and depth
I'm trying to predict future earthquakes.
