# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Earthquake Analysis Part 1**
An earthquake analysis that is exploratory in nature. In addition, machine learning techniques are being used to forecast future earthquakes. 

using **Python** with Scikit, matplotlib, anytree, basemap, numpy, mycolorpy and pandas were utilized as libraries.

**Concerning Data**
I relied on USGS Earthquake Data.
The data above is available in csv format. This dataset covers earthquakes from 1970 to 2017.

**Experiment**<br>
1. I calculated the frequency of earthquakes<br>
2. I drew a graph to show the incidence of earthquakes per year.<br>
3. I made a histogram between the frequency of earthquake events and several earthquake variables such as location (Longitude, Latitude) and Magnitude and depth<br>
4. I made a scatter plot between earthquake variables such as location (Longitude, Latitude) and Magnitude and depth<br>
5. I'm trying to predict future earthquakes.<br>
